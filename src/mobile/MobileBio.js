                        Greg Hunter was born and raised in Southern California . Although he was
                        introduced to golf at an early age by his father, Hunter chose to surf and race
                        bicycles. Fixing and maintaining his equipment was his first taste of mechanics.
                        When Hunter was 10 years old, he surfed in Makaha, Hawaii for the first time. As
                        time passed he got into racing motorcycles and skate boarding as well. Later as a
                        teenager he began working full-time and started surfing competitively.
